## 👩‍💻 Profile Summary
I am a **B.Tech Generative AI student** focused on building **strong computer science fundamentals** and applying them through consistent hands-on practice.

I believe in learning concepts deeply, writing clean and readable code, and improving through regular iteration rather than shortcuts.

## 📘 Current Technical Focus
- **Data Structures (C)** – problem solving, logic building, algorithmic thinking  
- **Python** – core programming, structured coding, OOP basics  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control, collaboration, clean commit history  

This GitHub profile represents my **active learning process**, not just finished outcomes.
